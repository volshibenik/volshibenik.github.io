      <p class="text">Dungeon Crawler is a rogue-like browser game. Player starts in a randomly generated dungeon, 
          populated with enemies. Dungeon represents a 2D map of square tiles. Square tiles generally are of two types: wall,
          that player can dig, and floor, that can be walked over. Game is turn based, player's turn is followed by 
          monsters turn. At his turn player can move in one of four directions or wait. When player tries to move in a square,
          occupied by a monster, he instead automatically attacks that monster. In order to win, player must eliminate every
          monster on map and then kill final boss, who will only appear after death of all other enemies. Player can find items
          on a dungeon floor, that can help him by increasing his stats. To pick up such an item, player has to step over it.
